    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Hey you! Come here and listen! I've just lost my pupil to one of those ghosts. I'll make you my new student if you show me what you can do. For starters simply kill 12 ghosts. Hehehe. Some day you may become a great ghost buster - just like me.</value>

  <data name="QS_HyruleRivers_TheEvilGhost" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My last pupil was killed by the Ghost King that lives deep in the woods of Hyrule Rivers. Now go and avenge him. If you succeed then you can have his old ghost necklace.</value>

    <value>Have you seen the black block? We've sealed the pathway beyond. If you bring me 1x Goron Steel and 3x Goron Croisants, then I can craft you a key to open it. Especially the Croisants are important! They should be around here somewhere..</value>

    <value>The evil Blood Keeses that have appeared last month eat my poor little baby chickens! And some of the older chickens turned -all- mad after they have been bitten. We must figure out this mystery! Bring me a few feathers of the mad chickens, and on the way slay some of those Bloody Keeses!</value>

    <value>As you inspect the doll you can clearly see that it is broken. If one could just repair it...  5x Fabric + 1x Red Dye should do it. To create Red Dye I will need 1x Small Empty Bottle + 2x Skeleton Bone Powder + 5x Red Potion.</value>

    <value>Hey you! How did you get here? I think some strange boy sent us here ... I really can't remember. Do you see the entrance next to me? That's the entrance to the Family Stone Tombs. Just recently it was overrun by monsters. You look rather strong. Can't you help us out and make the place a bit safer? Those green skeletons scare us ...</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_CleanseTheTombs_2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An even greater evil than some skeletons has infested the tombs. And my feeling tells me that they will leave the tombs soon. Just don't tell my younger brother~. He'd be scared to death! All I can tell you is that they are evil, eat fish and are female! Get them!!</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_CleanseTheTombs_3" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Hey you. Do you want to work for me? Of course you do. I'm Billy. Everyone wants to help me. Anyway I need you to do some work for me. I need the fields to the west to be cleared of those skeletons and skeleton heads. I may give you a reward. Just go! Or are you too scared?</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_FreshLeaves" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why, hello there too. You are asking what is going on? Well.. I won't tell you... until you bring me 5 fresh leaves for my daily medicine! There should be some just north of here. Would you be so nice?</value>

    <value>Hello hello! Do you hear me? Can't you just simply bring me 4 Ghost Mushrooms? Yes, yes. You should be able to find some at the Hyrule Rivers. *coughs* No need to get wet just yet. Simply cross the bridge in the far south east. *coughs*</value>

    <value>You break the seal of the letter and read: ............... Dear mother, I hope this letter reaches you quickly. Those skeletons are just too stupid to follow orders. I've sent two more 'adventurers' to the family tombs. The demon master will be -very- happy with us. Now back to the case with my little sister Milly. Have you managed to create the potion for her? I'd help you but I'm just too busy. Your Billy &lt;3.</value>

    <value>Boy boy. I now want you to find the ritual place to the far south west. Perform the fire ritual by simply litting the fires in the right pattern.  Do what I say or you'll face the consequences.</value>

    <value>Hello stranger! Nice to meet you! I'm Milly, the future princess of these lands. You've helped my dear brother Billy? Oh dear ... my brother ... He has been acting strangely lately. And now he wants the secret-map of the family tombs back! He'll hurt me again if I don't bring the map back. :'( The map is somewhere in the woods, guarded by those razor blades. Please, please bring it to me!</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_TheNiceFather" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hello. Who's there? Oh, you the young fighter. Your deeds already reached my kind ears. What do you say? Billy seems to beat poor Milly? Hmm ... You must know that we must train her to endure all physical and mental stress. Anyway, I'm going to talk with Billy about Milly. Beating her is indeed too much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_TheNotSoNiceMother" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hello hello! You must speak louder or I won't hear you! ... Yes. I am the mother of Milly. And it's known to me that Billy beats Milly. It was my order after all. Be gone now.</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_TheRouteOfDin" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Phew, thanks again for your help. I fear that our older sister Maja is in trouble too! She has been protecting our chickens. You may find her near the Route of Din in the far north west. Hey, take this key. It will allow you to leave this island quickly! Please, help our sister!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_TheSister" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hey, don't just run off. If you havn't spoken to my sister yet.. You will help her too. She should be hiding somewhere to the south.</value>

  <data name="QS_TiaWoods_TheSkeletonHunt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My family owns large parts of the Tia Woods. All was great until the skeletons came and most of our workers fled. Those bastards! Your next quest shall be to avenge me and my family. Hunt those skeletons like you've never hunted something else before! Your reward is near ..! Oh, and before I forget it ... if you see my lil' sister - tell her to HURRY.</value>
